## Work Experience

### Frontend Software Engineer at SonarSource

**Remote, US**

I am currently working with my team inside Sonar to deliver Tidelift’s software composition analysis (SCA) capabilities to millions of developers who use Sonar. My main responsibility is new feature work in React working closely with UX designers (Figma) and backend developers to quickly establish goals and requirements.

### Senior Frontend Engineer at Tidelift

**Remote, US**

Prior to the acquisition, I was an individual contributor to our customer-facing frontend. I’ve helped lead initiatives across the product. I’m recognized by my colleagues and manager as a Vue.js expert, an advocate for close teamwork, and best practices like meaningful code review.

* Lead the implementation of a broad redesign of the look-and-feel of our application
* Guided our team through rewriting the majority of the codebase in TypeScript and building consensus and philosophy around how we derive value from a type system
* Work closely with our design and product teams to turn Figma designs into polished, performant features
* Improved our error reporting and instrumentation metrics, and used them to improve the stability of our application
* Reduced development overhead how we package and build our in-house component library
Worn other hats too, like running data experiments in python, building backend rails features, and improving the engineer onboarding experience with docker

### Research & Development Engineer (Full Stack) at Kitware

**Carrboro, NC**

Responsible for planning and building scientific web applications in Python and TypeScript. I often worked directly with external customers and end-users to discover, refine, and implement requirements. Often deployed SaaS + ML workloads into cloud environments with Ansible/Terraform using some combination of EC2/ECS/S3/RDS/API Gateway (or GCloud equivalents) and even some Mechanical Turk image annotation.

### Software Engineer at Capital One

**Mclean, VA**

Worked with a pilot team to design and implement queueing and microservices for a scalable generic payment processing system with Apache Kafka and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). Contributed to Golang message gateway, CI/CD for multiple components, Terraform for fault-tolerant Kafka deployment, and internal dashboards.

### Software Engineer Intern at Cisco

**Raleigh, NC**

Contributed to Django API to interface with internal bug tracking systems, Python tool to catalog and generate checksums for ~100TB of router firmware, backup scripts for PostgreSQL.

### QA Intern at SQL Sentry (now SentryOne)

**Charlotte, NC**

Created a robust test suite in Ranorex for automating nightly production web application testing, enabling faster detection of problems in our web services. Developed internal tools in C# to extend MS Team Foundation Server task management to catalog new test cases and include them in future regression tests.
