1. [CityScape Blog](https://www.minnpost.com/category/cityscape/) is one of my favorite columns. Written by UMN lecturer [Bill Lindeke](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/linde082), it covers local urban planning, transportation, housing issues, and local politics. Bill clearly cares a lot. [RSS Feed](https://www.minnpost.com/category/cityscape/feed/). Other [MinnPost](https://www.minnpost.com/) coverage is subscribable by category. I personally follow the [Metro News section](https://www.minnpost.com/category/metro/). Each has its own RSS feed; just add `/feed/` to the end of the URL.

1. [Racket](https://racketmn.com/) is a place I look for local events and culture coverage. They do a much better job than most other outlets at not sounding like a small town paper from 2005. Their news and politics coverage leans toward an editorial style I can only describe as 2018 huff post, which you're either into or not. [RSS Feed](https://racketmn.com/feed/)

1. [Streets.mn](https://streets.mn/) is a volunteer-run nonprofit urbanist blog. They have a surprising feed volume and level of quality. Tone skews wonkish, and there's a real community behind this site. [RSS Feed](https://streets.mn/feed/)

1. [Wedge Live](https://wedgelive.com/), the singular phenomenon from the triangle-shaped section between Hennepin and Lyndale. Only a few posts a year (except on election years), and each one is a banger. [RSS Feed](https://wedgelive.com/feed/)

1. [Downtown Voices](https://www.downtownvoices.news/) is weird and I don't understand what their deal is. They publish a newsletter on Wednesdays and occasionally I'll get something out of it.

1. [Mill City Times](https://millcitytimes.com/) is a hyperlocal, hyper-earnest nonprofit outlet run by a tiny staff covering wholesome shit like business grand openings, "tips" from the fire department, and interviews. This is the 2005 local paper I was talking about. Very low post volume. Most of the time I swipe it away, but occasionaly there's [something worth reading](http://millcitytimes.com/news/september-3-bridge-9-improvements-project-update.html). [ATOM feed](http://millcitytimes.com/news/atom.xml)

1. [Better Minneapolis](https://betterminneapolis.substack.com/) is a Substack newsletter by green party former council candidate Terry White. I disagree with a lot of what Terry writes, and his style is amateurish. Others have referred to both Better Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Times (where he is a contributor) as conservative-leaning. I'd refer to them as contrarian centrists. I keep this in my feed because I like a broad media diet. [RSS Feed](https://www.betterminneapolis.com/feed)
