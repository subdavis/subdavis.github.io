So tailwind has a "plus" product, which it will sell you for $299 ($1000 for teams). That includes an slick-looking React component kit plus the kind of generic UI blocks that you see on every corpo product website.

But that's not all! They have entire website templates for...

* launching a podcast
* b2b SaaS nonsense
* marketing websites for selling b2b SaaS nonsense
* buidling your own coursera clone?

Which all sounds rather dull, except the copy editor came to play.

## Are you a 10x engineer?

They've got a personal site template called [spotlight](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight).

The demo features a strong-jawed white dude somewhere between 15 and 30. Tag line? **Software designer, founder, and amateur astronaut.**

It's cheeky. Playful. Don't take yourself too seriously, there, elon!!

> I’m Spencer Sharp. I live in New York City, where I design the future.

Ok bub. Tell us a little bit about yourself.

> I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to type on.

So far it's low-effort cringe. Hard to tell if Tailwind is in on their own joke or not. What does Spencer have on the blog?

> Writing on software design, company building, and the aerospace industry.

Spencer's a tool, OK?

> When you’re building a website for a company as ambitious as Planetaria, you need to make an impression. I wanted people to visit our website and see animations that looked **more realistic than reality itself.**
>
> To make this possible, we needed to squeeze **every drop of performance** out of the browser possible. And so Animaginary was born.

C'mon baby. Quit dragging your feet. Hit me with the punchline.

>  ```ts
>  import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary'
>
>  export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
>    return (
>      <animate.div
>        in={open}
>        animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
>        animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
>        duration={350}
>      >
>        {children}
>      </animate.div>
>    )
>  }
>  ```
>
> Animaginary is our new web animation library that **redefines what you thought was possible** on the web. Hand-written in optimized WASM, Animaginary can even animate the height property of an element at 60fps.

TWIST THE KNIFE.

To risk ruining the joke, 

At least Spencer is a little bit self-aware.

> I derive a large amount of my self-worth from whether or not Hacker News is impressed with the work I'm doing, so when I realized this, I cancelled all of our existing projects and started migrating everything to Rust immediately.

Don't be like spencer. Chill.

## CSS boilerplate for devs with a humiliation kink

It's honestly endearing that Tailwind thinks so little of the people who buy their product.

Translated literally, here's what I read into their demo.

> Look at all this worthless bullshit you can build!
>
> It's all a waste of time, but knock yourself out, kid.
>
> Just give us the cash and scram.
>
> XOXO, tailwind

...are they wrong?
