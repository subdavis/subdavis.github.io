Ok so tailwind has a "plus" product, which it will sell you for $299 ($1000 for teams) that includes an excellent-looking React component kit plus the kind of generic UI blocks that you see on every corpo product website.

But that's not all! They have entire website templates for 

* launching a podcast
* b2b saas nonsense
* buidling your own coursera clone?

..and the live demo page copy author came to play.

## Are you a 10x engineer?

They've got this "personal site" template called [spotlight](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight).  The demo features a strong-jawed white dude somewhere between 15 and 30.

Tag line: **Software designer, founder, and amateur astronaut.**

It's cheeky. Playful. Don't take yourself too seriously, there, elon!!

> I’m Spencer Sharp. I live in New York City, where I design the future.

Ok bub. Tell us a little bit about yourself.

> I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to type on.

So far it's low-quality cringe, ChatGPT might say.

What does Spencer have on the blog?

> Writing on software design, company building, and the aerospace industry.

Spencer's into some serious shit.

> When you’re building a website for a company as ambitious as Planetaria, you need to make an impression. I wanted people to visit our website and see animations that looked **more realistic than reality itself.**
>
> To make this possible, we needed to squeeze **every drop of performance** out of the browser possible. And so Animaginary was born.

C'mon baby. Hit me with the punchline.

```ts
import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary'

export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
  return (
    <animate.div
      in={open}
      animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
      animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
      duration={350}
    >
      {children}
    </animate.div>
  )
}
```

> Animaginary is our new web animation library that **redefines what you thought was possible** on the web. Hand-written in optimized WASM, Animaginary can even animate the height property of an element at 60fps.

TWIST THE KNIFE. But wait, there's more.

> When we released the first version of cosmOS last year, it was written in Go. Go is a wonderful programming language with a lot of benefits, but it’s been a while since I’ve seen an article on the front page of Hacker News about rewriting some important tool in Go and I see articles on there about rewriting things in Rust every single week.

> I derive a large amount of my self-worth from whether or not Hacker News is impressed with the work I'm doing, so when I realized this, I cancelled all of our existing projects and started migrating everything to Rust immediately.

The pivotal code this post? Left pad.

It feels like watching an episode of Silicon Valley: I'm laughing, but now it might be starting to hurt a little bit.

## CSS boilerplate for devs with a humiliation kink

It's honestly endearing that Tailwind thinks so little of the people who buy this product.

The whole thing reads to me like this...

> You have nothing worth building and nothing important to say.
>
> Just give us cash and get out.
>
> XOXO, tailwind

Are they wrong?
