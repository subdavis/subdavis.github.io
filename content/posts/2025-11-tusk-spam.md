description: A decade later, adware vendors still want your chrome extension

I've been getting spam emails about selling or monitizing Tusk almost since it was published in 2018. Usually it's one of two offers:

* People wanting to buy the extension outright
* People wanting to pay you to install their "SDK" that does some kind of ad injection or search hijacking or data mining or all of the above.

Some come from sketchy gmail accounts, some from semi-professional looking domains. One in particular, Ads-Connect.co.uk, was actually incorporated in the UK from 2020 until it was dissolved in 2022 and had employees on LinkedIn.

The first account I can find is from [Amit Agarwal in Jan 2014](https://www.labnol.org/internet/sold-chrome-extension/28377).

> It was a 4-figure offer for something that had taken an hour to create and I agreed to the deal. I had no clue about the buyer and was also curious to know why would anyone pay this kind of money for such a simple Chrome extension.

My offers, taken at face value, would similarly shell out thousands for Tusk at 10 - 20 cents per user. Depending on the developer's financial situation, that could be real cash.

Anyway, here's a sample of the messages I've gotten over the years.

Hello, I'm a reseller, specializing in buying and selling chrome extensions.
I appreciate your extension and want to buy it.
If you intend to sell it, then message me for its price.
If not you can also reply to my email and I will give the price.
After agreeing on the price, we can trade through (escrow .com). This is a trading intermediary website, you can learn it.
Google allows the transfer of extension ownership to another account, so don't worry.

Hope you will reply

I am Isabella Clarke from Ads Connect and wanted to reach out to you to offer a way to increase revenue from your Chrome extension KeePass Tusk - Password Access and Autofill as this is a premium product from Bing by invitation only.

We are providing an opportunity to add an online search function to your Chrome extension. Bing highly monetise searches made through them. In your case, with 30K+, you could earn $3,720.00 per month, and we don't want you to miss out on such an opportunity.
If your extension does not have search this is not a problem with a simple update this can be added, furthermore it is completely acceptable by Google Chrome store.

We are also offering extension owners an opportunity to sell their extension to us for a good and honest price taking into consideration the current market, the extension functionality and the user base.  If you are curious about such offers and would like to find out the market price for your extension, we could discuss this further.

Any questions about either opportunities I am happy to help.

Kind Regards
