Podcasts are nice. They show up in chronological order, often download automatically in the background, and work the same no matter "where you get your podcasts". In a world of algorithmic social "for you" feeds, this is a genuine miracle.

Science fiction authors, especially those of cozycore novel(las) like A Half Built Garden or A Psalm for the Wild Built have imagined what a less enshitified, more human internet might look like. Platforms like BlueSky and Mastodon followed this ethos too.

## It's just RSS

The technology of this hopeful future actually came out in 1999. It's just [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Every morning I fire up NetNewsWire. God Himself cannot tamper with the sanctity or sort order of my feed. I pick something, open it up, and read it. Nobody tracks me. There are no cookie policies to accept. There's no like button or comment section.

In the days before profit motives caught up, human beings understood that the media you wanted to access had very little to do with the "platform" it was distributed by. Imagine Youtube videos and Instagram comments and new issues of The Atlantic all just appear in one chronological feed. The obvious problem with all this control is that nobody can sell ads or harvest your personal data if you're in your own chosen software (Outside of a web browser! Offline, maybe even!).

## Podcast freedom fleeting

Even podcasts may not have this freedom forever as companies try to capture the remaining frontier. The New York Times is taking steps to force listeners into their own app. Spotify made major plays in the last few years to get exclusive podcasts behind their paywall. Podcasters now implore that you watch their episodes on YouTube, where they can more effectively monitize and you can get locked into yet another platform you don't want to use.

It's perfectly reasonable to want subscribers to pay for your content. Substack and Patreon are positive role models for how this should work: You give them cash and they give you an individualized subscription link to import the feed in your own app. The ads you hear are at the discretion of the creator, not the platform.

## RSS, the ghost protocol

Despite the incentives for companies to keep you on their site, looking at their ads, contributing to their engagement metrics, RSS persists. Idealistic software engineers have built the feature into most of the content management platforms that companies use (mostly for free) like Wordpress. Some sites, like The Atlantic, publish articles paywall-free through difficult-to-find RSS feeds.

In a future post I'll share a bit more about finding and using these old web relics.
