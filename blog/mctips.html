<title>Tips for Managing a Minecraft Server</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">
My name is Brandon, but the Minecraft community knows me as suB - the guy who kept [Redspin MC](http://www.planetminecraft.com/server/redspinmc/) up and running for the last year.  Through dealings with hundreds of players and thousands of console errors, I've learned a fair bit about what makes a good server - and what doesn't.

Harken and let me impart some wisdom to you, Minecraft padawans.

###Ideas for New Servers

Please keep in mind that this article is geared toward those who want to open a PUBLIC server for the masses, and not so much so for people who are just looking to play some survival with close friends.  

Before you ever even purchase a server, you need an Idea.  It doesn't have to be earth-shattering or supremely unique, but you need to have some clue about what you are going to do.  

At the time of writing this, every kid spending their parents' money had a PvP factions server with mini-games.  My advice is that if you can go onto the [planetminecraft.com server page](http://planetminecraft.com/resources/servers) and find 2 or 3 examples just like what you are planning, you need a new idea.  Go simple; get a few plugins that *everybody* isn't using which change gameplay in an interesting way.

###Grand Opening

The hardest thing a new server must do is not setting up permissions.  It isn't trying to design the spawn layout or get a website running.  The hardest thing you will have to do is get - and keep - new players.  Who wants to play on a brand new server where nobody plays except the owner and original staff?  How do you convince quality players that the server won't go down for good in just a few weeks? As a friend says,

>PlanetMinecraft - You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.

If you advertise on their server page, you will likely get a steady flow of very low-quality players who are only interested in griefing, filling chat with profanity, and advertising for other servers.  However, there are diamonds in the rough.  Stay vigilant, ban the troublemakers, and you will be rewarded with some new and loyal players 

Other ways of getting traffic include posting to the Minecraft forums (generally a higher caliber userbase) or even spam-commenting on MC-related YouTube videos.  That was surprisingly successful, and many of the folks we gained were also excellent players.

###Staff

From the very beginning, you will need members of staff.  Start with only a few, picked preferably from players you already know from other servers or even in real life.  Staff picked from brand new players are likely to cause trouble or disappear quickly.  You should NOT advertise for staff on forums like PMC or MC Forums.  These players just want to have some OP commands - they don't care where.  As you begin to get some regulars, approach your favorites and ask them if they would be interested in starting at your lowest staff rank.

As far as quantity goes, 3 or 4 members of staff to begin with is plenty.  It's discouraging for new players to see a staff list with 20 people when the server barely has 5 players.  As a rule of thumb I just made up, if you have more total staff than you have online players at peak traffic times, you have too many.

This brings me to staff ranking.  In my opinion, fewer ranks are better.  I've even played with the idea of having a single **staff** rank so that nobody has power over anyone else.  That being said I recommend the following hierarchy:

> TrialMod/Helper -> Moderator -> Admin -> Owner

Create a staff channel in Skype or Teamspeak and encourage all members to suggest ideas or report issues so that everyone knows what's up.  

Staff ranks should not be as much a pecking order as a definition of responsibilities.  TrialMods are getting a feel for how the staff operate.  Mods keep tabs on chat and answer player's questions about the server.  They can take limited action against players like mute and tempban.  They don't have to concern themselves with the inner workings of the server or problems with plugin configuration or glitches.  This is what you have Administrators for.

> Administrators are very misunderstood in the Minecraft community.  They are not just Mods who can permban.  They should hold all the keys to the kingdom and be able to troubleshoot problems independently without the owner.  If the owner is unavailable, an Admin should be just as capable.  If you don't fully trust a player to take care of things while you are away, they have no business being an Admin.

###Ownership

So what are you responsible for then?  Well, everything else.  The server is your creative medium, so your time is best spent brainstorming new features and keeping the back-end running smoothly.  Monitor RAM and CPU usage to be sure that you are on an appropriately size host.  Test new plugins with your staff.  Design fun server events like PvP tournaments or Drop parties.  You are the king of your own little realm.

As an Owner, people often told me they liked how active I was.  Owners should be online frequently and be approachable by players.  

If you ever find yourself logging and seeing *ZOMG IT'S THE OWNER*, you will know that... 
1. you have a pretty successful server.
2. you need to play more.  

I took pride in the fact that players trusted me to handle their disputes and settle issues, and that they felt confident in my ability to run the place.  Don't be above your players.  Play with them.  Earn their respect.

###Chat Formatting

This is actually more important than you may think.  I've been on servers where auto broadcasts spammed your chat box and kept you from reading any player messages.  I've seen servers that fill up the whole first line of a player message was his/her prefix.   
```
[World][SuperBarbarianLady]+TS+C:TheAmazingEmily!> Example message 
```
Don't do that.  It's hideous and will turn players away.  I recommend:
```
[Rank] playername> Example message
```
Stay away from flashy auto-broadcasts, and have a clean simple login message.  If you have to scroll up to see it all, it's too big.  Lastly, never color the actual message part of yours or a staff's chat.  If normal players talk in white and you talk in bright red, you will look like you are above everyone.  If people respect you, they will read what you type in chat anyway.

###Technical

The technical side of server ownership should not be overlooked.  Set things up properly and at least look like you know what you're doing.  The following tips are a necessity if you want to be taken seriously.

1. Make sure to get a host that lets you use the default port (25565)
2. Buy a domain name.  Nobody likes using IP addresses. Also use [CloudFlare.com](http://cloudflare.com) for DNS - It will be faster than your Registrar's DNS.
3. Avoid Multicraft.  If you get big, multicraft will limit you.  Learn how to manage an MC server on a VPS with SSH access.
4. You need more RAM than everyone says you do.  If you buy a 20 slot server, you will crash it at 10-12.  If you buy a 40-slot, it will crash before 30.  This is with vanilla.  If you are running mods, you will crash long before that.  Start at 2GB and scale up from there.
5. Run spigot.  Spigot is just like Bukkit, but conserves resources and includes an ore obfuscation engine for misleading X-ray clients.  It can be glitchier, but the benefits generally outweigh the risks.
6. Use CoreProtect.  It's the best damn plugin there is.

###Odds and Ends

Thanks for reading this article.  I wish you the best of luck with starting or improving a server. If I can been of assistance at all, you can reach me on twitter [@subdavis](https://twitter.com/subdavis).  I'd give you my email, but the spam crawlers would find it and spam me some more :P
