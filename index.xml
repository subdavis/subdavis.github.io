I kept reddit under the happy delusion that I could learn to use it responsibly (lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve often thought about what the experience of being &amp;ldquo;on the internet&amp;rdquo; is like, and how that&amp;rsquo;s changed since I began forming digital habits back in High School. My memory is relatively poor, so a habit-forming tool for capturing a bit of life is wonderful. Having my good intentions packaged up to generate ad revenue and give teenagers an anxiety disorder is less so.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
