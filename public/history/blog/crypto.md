###A total noob's adventure in BitCoin

I bought BitCoins.  Actually, I bought a small part of a BitCoin because at the time of my purchase, they valued at about $588 USD.

I've spent the last year in a special kind of self-loathing for not buying into BitCoin (BTC) back before the price went through the roof in September of 2013.  It's time I got in on the action.

I'm not planning to strike it rich in the virtual currency revolution - I missed that gravy train by miles - but I wanted to educate myself about how exactly this oddity worked.  What I found out is that the process of buying coins is pretty difficult, but still easier and less shady than it was in times past.

####Getting Started
Buying BitCoin isn't like going to an ordinary online store where you punch in a credit card number and confirmation is delivered to your inbox.  Buying BTC involves creating an account with one of the various exchanges.  A comprehensive list can be found [here](http://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/).

I naturally chose the top result, currently [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com), and signed up.  Note that coinbase is running a promotion for $5 worth of free bitcoins when make your first purchase and put in a bunch of scary personal information.  They _say_ that if you sign up with a .edu email account, you can get $10 worth free.  Many students still report trouble with this promotion, but it has worked for a fair few.

I found out later that CoinBase is the preferred market of [keybase.io](http://keybase.io/bdavis), allowing users to confirm their CoinBase accounts using a statement like [this](https://coinbase.com/subdavis/public-key).

To sign up, you need to add a bank account.  This requires the account and routing numbers, kind of like PayPal does.  You can confirm instantly by letting CoinBase log in to your bank website for you, or go through a three day confirmation where they make small deposits and ask for the amount.
