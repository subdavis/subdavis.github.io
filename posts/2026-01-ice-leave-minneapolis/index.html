I decided to put it back.</div><p><img src=./beautiful-vigil-for-renee-good-tonight-v0-zbw5765qk2cg1.webp alt="Renee Good Vigil"></p><p>I live in Minneapolis, where on Jan 7 Renee Good was killed by an ICE officer while trying to flee from another officer attempting to force her car door open. Moments before, she is seen on camera waving out her window for the ICE vehicle to pass using the open lane in front of her.</p><p>Neither the footage nor a single eyewitness account agrees with the <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1q6mg02>DHS official statement</a>. <strong>All bystanders</strong> perceived that she was scared and trying to escape.</p><p><a href=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/fbi-will-investigate-after-ice-agent-shoots-renee-good-in-minneapolis>Now, the FBI have forced MN state authorities out of the case</a></p><h2 id=the-reality>The reality</h2><p>There are many different angles. <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gb_IkGVK7WvsTAXfMvQUoM4a1P3VwXiu>Here they are in a Google Drive folder.

The officers get out of a running vehicle, and could have chosen to drive by without stopping to confront her at all. Turn the sound on and you&rsquo;ll hear how alarmed bystanders are by the sudden escalation: nobody on either side of the conflict had clocked Renee as a threat or someone who was behaving erratically.</p><p><img src=./exact-frames-of-each-of-the-3-shots-fired-showing-visible.jpg alt="Frame by frame"></p><h2 id=other-information>Other information</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latest-news-trump-maduro_n_695bb603e4b0d6beb5fd9469/liveblog_695ebd75e4b0b3db6e4d7e52>Video: ICE blocks doctor from assisting the victim</a></li><li><a href=https://x.com/tradinglara/status/2009279272188248438>Video: DHS officer stomps on memorial to Renee</a></li><li><a href=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/20/chongly-scott-thao-says-ice-removed-him-from-home-in-his-underwear-after-warrantless-search>ICE continues to illegally arrest citizens without cause</a></li></ul><h2 id=a-final-note>A final note</h2><p>If this feels out of place or uncomforable, that is sort of the point.
