Moments before, she is seen on camera waving out her window for the ICE vehicle to pass her using the open lane in front of her.</p><p>Neither the footage nor a single eyewitness account agrees with the <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/1q6mg02>DHS official statement</a>. <strong>All bystanders</strong> perceived that she was scared and trying to escape.</p><p><a href=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/fbi-will-investigate-after-ice-agent-shoots-renee-good-in-minneapolis>Now, the FBI have forced MN state authorities out of the case</a></p><h2 id=the-footage>The footage</h2><p>There are 3 angles. <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gb_IkGVK7WvsTAXfMvQUoM4a1P3VwXiu>Here is the Google Drive folder. Watch with caution.</a></p><p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CJY5p0xz4">fourth video (warning: graphic)</a> is the longer cut of the left angle. In it, you can see the ICE officer who killed Renee Good abandon the scene in a gold SUV without waiting for medical aid or other authorities arrive.</p><p>Here are the exact frames where shots are fired.</p><p><img src=./exact-frames-of-each-of-the-3-shots-fired-showing-visible-v0-0pqmmig3e2cg1.webp alt="Shots fired frames"></p><p>Kristi Noem said <a href=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-condemns-alleged-attack-ice-agents-stuck-snow-minneapolis-act-domestic-terrorism>at a conference</a> that</p><blockquote><p>As they were attempting to push the vehicle [out of the snow], she said a woman &ldquo;attacked them and those surrounding them&rdquo; and &ldquo;attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>These videos show no such thing. The officers get out of a running vehicle, and could have chosen to drive by without stopping to confront her at all. Turn the sound on and you&rsquo;ll hear how alarmed bystanders are by the sudden escalation: nobody on either side of the conflict had clocked Renee as a threat or someone who was even behaving erratically or aggressively.</p><h2 id=other-information>Other information</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latest-news-trump-maduro_n_695bb603e4b0d6beb5fd9469/liveblog_695ebd75e4b0b3db6e4d7e52>Video: ICE blocks doctor from the shooting victim</a></li><li><a href=https://x.com/tradinglara/status/2009279272188248438>Video: DHS officer stomps on memorial to Renee</a></li><li><a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/minnesota-ice-shooting-live-updates-rcna252852#rcrd95863>ICE officers are trained never to approach a vehicle from the front</a></li></ul><h2 id=a-final-note>A final note</h2><p>If this feels out of place or uncomforable, that is sort of the point.
