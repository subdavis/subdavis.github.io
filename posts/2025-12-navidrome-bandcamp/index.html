Toward the bottom of that article, Nik documents his end-to-end purchase workflow. It&rsquo;s horrible. It takes ~10 manual steps and nearly as many different websites to&mldr; buy an album.</p><p>There are powerful, convenient tools for stealing (which I use!) But if you want to buy things, the only platform not aggressively doing vendor ecosystem lock-in is Bandcamp. It has no consumer-facing API, its app kinda sucks, and there&rsquo;s no good way to grab your purchases except one-at-a-time through the browser.</p><h2 id=metadata-management>Metadata management</h2><p>Serving music files is trivially easy. The metadata management is what gets ya.</p><p>A lot of music doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into the album model (singles, collabs, compilation albums, live recordings) and 2 main tools attempt to help you organize your library.</p><p>Lidarr solves these things somewhat clumsily by hammering them into its exising album model, but it has worked well enough for me.</p><h3 id=lidarr-vs-beets>Lidarr vs Beets</h3><p>Lidar is primarily a piracy tool (it&rsquo;s a <a href=https://wiki.servarr.com/>servARR</a> after all) and <a href=https://beets.io/>Beets</a> is primarily a metadata management tool, so I started out trying to use Beets as my primary library manager.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no good web interface for beets. <a href=https://github.com/pSpitzner/beets-flask>beets-flask</a> shows a lot of potential but it&rsquo;s too immature to use with a big collection yet. It only supports copy import and the interface quickly clutters with imported media. You end up with a lot of directories to deal with. Beets itself has a steep lerning curve and too much reliance on a magical plugin system. It&rsquo;s hard to heal the metadata DB if you fuck something up.</p><p>Some people (including me) have tried a <code>torrent -> lidarr -> beets -> server</code> but that violated my KISS needs.</p><p>I ended up using Beets to get my library in shape, then, once the file structure and file names were reliably consistent with MusicBrainz data, I pointed Lidarr at the same libraray directory and rebuilt it inside Lidarr. Its metadata management is good enough for me.</p><h2 id=the-one-click-workflow>The one-click workflow</h2><p><img src=./sync.png alt="Sync screenshot"></p><p>Until bandcamp build webhooks (fat chance), you need at least 1 click to trigger a re-scan of your purchases.</p><ul><li>Buy an album on Bandcamp</li><li>Swap over to my Bandcamp Sync Flask instance and click &ldquo;Run sync&rdquo;. It pulls every purchase into the same shared library directory that Lidarr uses.</li><li>Everything else is automated by Lidarr and Navidrome. Bandcamp albums are sufficiently enriched that Lidarr can figure out what to do with them on its own.</li></ul><p>Stuff should appear in your media player within a minute or two. This obviously doesn&rsquo;t work if the thing you bought is too obscure to have landed in MusicBrainz yet, but I&rsquo;m not enough of a hipster to be buying albums like that.</p><h2 id=the-repo-bandcamp-sync-flask>The repo: Bandcamp Sync Flask</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/subdavis/bandcamp-sync-flask>https://github.com/subdavis/bandcamp-sync-flask</a></p><p>Credit and kudos to <a href="https://github.com/subdavis/bandcamp-sync-flask?tab=readme-ov-file">BandcampSync</a> which is the script this app wraps.</p></div><footer class="mt-8 pt-8 border-t border-accent-200 flex justify-between items-center"><a href=/posts class="text-accent-700 hover:text-accent-700">← Back to all posts
