Were they really <a href=ttps://1037theloon.com/minnesota-winters-really-were-worse-in-the-70s-80s/>worse in the 80s</a>?</p><p>Memory is foggy. Averages and trendlines can be hard to relate to subjective personal experience. The average annual temperature in Minnesota has <a href=https://climate.umn.edu/MNclimate>increased by 3.2°F</a> between 1895 and 2024, but a ~0.5 degree per decade increase is not easy to feel year to year.</p><p>Still, the Twin Cities are experiencing climate change. That mostly means more variable weather patterns. Bigger swings, not just steady warming. Can we see that in the data?</p><h2 id=snowfall-trends>Snowfall trends</h2><p>Snowfall is probably the biggest factor for of how a winter is remembered.</p><p>There are some trends in first-order measures of snowfall, but they may not be what you expect. Both total snowfall and variability from winter to winter are <strong>increasing</strong>. Variability is actually down somewhat since an elevated period from about 1970 to 2010.</p><p>My rolling standard deviation is somewhat arbitrary, so I included both a 20 year and a 30 year to show sensitivity to the window size.</p><div class=chart style="position:relative;height:400px;width:100%;margin-bottom:calc(var(--spacing) * 6)"><canvas
