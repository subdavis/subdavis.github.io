They show up in chronological order, download in the background, and work the same in every app. In a world of algorithmic walled garden social &amp;ldquo;platforms&amp;rdquo;, this is a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t more of the internet be like that? As &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/social-media-algorithms-twitter-meta-rss-reader/673282/"&gt;Yair Rosenberg wrote in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, you can take back control of what you see on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="its-just-rss"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just RSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology of a hopeful future actually came out in 1999. It&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. Every morning I fire up NetNewsWire. God Himself cannot tamper with the sanctity or sort order of my feed. I pick something, open it up, and read it. Nobody tracks me. There are no cookie policies to accept. There&amp;rsquo;s no like button or comment section.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A few photos from Pittsburgh</title><link>https://subdavis.com/posts/2025-pittsburgh-photos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://subdavis.com/posts/2025-pittsburgh-photos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Photos from RandyLand, Bicycle Heaven, and around town in Pittsburgh, PA.

I kept reddit under the happy delusion that I could learn to use it responsibly (lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve often thought about what the experience of being &amp;ldquo;on the internet&amp;rdquo; is like, and how that&amp;rsquo;s changed since I began forming digital habits back in High School. My memory is relatively poor, so a habit-forming tool for capturing a bit of life is wonderful. Having my good intentions packaged up to generate ad revenue and give teenagers an anxiety disorder is less so. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/meta-is-earning-fortune-deluge-fraudulent-ads-documents-show-2025-11-06/"&gt;10% of Meta&amp;rsquo;s revenue for 2024 came from fraud.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
